## About Me

  Hello! My name is Patrick Kelly. I am a graduate student in the physics master's program at California State University, Fresno. My advisor is Dr. Ettore Vitali and my research with him is focused on statistical mechanics and computational physics. The main thread of my research focuses on using quantum Monte Carlo and random phase approximation to study cold atomic gases. I am involved with some research and pedagogical papers on these topics. I am also working on writing molecular dynamics codes from scratch. Currently, a friend and I are figuring out how to parellelize a code for a Lennard-Jones Fluid. I am also very interested in hybrid, multiscale computational methodologies that combine different levels of theory to account for more effects and produce more accurate results. Finally, in our spare time Dr. Vitali is teaching me stochastic calculus. 

## About this Blog

  I started this blog because there are a number of topics I am interested in understanding better. I think one of the best ways to further one's understanding of something is to explain it to others. That is the main intention of this blog. I will pick interesting topics and then try to give them a coherent explanation.
