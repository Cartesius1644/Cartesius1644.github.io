## About Me

  Hello! My name is Patrick Kelly. I am a graduate student in the physics master's program at California State University, Fresno. My supervisor is Dr. Ettore Vitali and my research with him is focused on statistical mechanics and computational physics. The main thread of my research focuses on quantum Monte Carlo simulations of cold atomic gases. I am involved with some research and pedagogical papers on these topics that are in the pipeline right now. I am also working on writing molecular dynamics codes from scratch. Currently, a friend and I are figuring out how to parellelize a code for a Lennard-Jones Fluid. So far most of my molecular dynamics work just involves reproducing methods that have been known for decades, but probably the best way to learn a new computational methodolgy is to make your own version from scratch. Longer term I want to simulate more complex systems with larger molecules and I may turn to biomolecules at some point. I also very interested in hybrid computation methodologies that combine different levels of theory to account for more effects and produce more accurate results. Finally, in our spare time Dr. Vitali is teaching me stochastic calculus. I am helping him prepare formal lecture notes about this.

## About This Blog

  I started this blog because there are a number of topics I am interested in understanding better. I think one of the best ways to further one's understanding of something is to explain it to others. That is the main intention of this blog. I will pick interesting topics and then try to give them a coherent explanation.
